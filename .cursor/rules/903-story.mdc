- Implementing responsive design for various screen sizes

## Chat Command Log

- MES: Let's implement the chessboard UI
- AiAgent: Reviewing the design requirements. Should we use SVG or PNG for pieces?
  - MES: Let's use SVG for better scaling
- AiAgent: Grid implementation complete, proceeding with piece placement
